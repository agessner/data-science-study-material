## Models

**Training** or **fitting** the model is the process capturing patterns from data.

The **data** used to **fit** the model is called the **training data**.

After the model has been fit we can apply it to new data to **predict**.

### Decision Tree

Example: We want to predict the value a house costs. We can make that by analysing some patters from sold houses. Like number bedrooms, for exemple. More bedrooms, expensier the house. That`s a decision tree. Kinda like an if and else. If we analyse one more feature, we'll have a deeper decision tree.

After we follow the house corresponding tree path, we'll get to the **leaf** where the price is.
